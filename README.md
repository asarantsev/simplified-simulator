Same as https://github.com/asarantsev/completed-simulator
but with simple autoregressions instead of a vector autoregression.

Full simulator of S&P 500, International (with emerging) Stocks, and Corporate Bonds, with BAA rate, long-short spread, the bubble measure, volatility, using kernel density estimation and filling missing innovations
